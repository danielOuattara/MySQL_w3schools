# MySQL SQL

##  What is SQL?

SQL is the standard language for dealing with Relational Databases.

SQL is used to insert, search, update, and delete database records.

##  How to Use SQL

The following SQL statement selects all the records in the
"Customers" table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers;
```

**Keep in Mind That :**

- SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: `select` is the same as `SELECT`

- In this tutorial we will write all SQL keywords in upper-case.

##  Semicolon after SQL Statements?

Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each
SQL statement.

Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in
database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be
executed in the same call to the server.

In this tutorial, we will use semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.
